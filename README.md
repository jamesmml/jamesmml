# Hello, my name is JamesðŸ‘‹


I am an AMEP (Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics) major passionate about ML and data science.

Iâ€™m building a strong foundation through my coursework to support this passion. My goal is to leverage my scientific background to develop innovative solutions in ML and data science.

- ðŸ”­ Currently expanding my `ml-from-scratch` repo to include Convolutional Neural Networks and exploring their applications in my medical imaging research at UW-Madison
- ðŸŒ± Focused on deepening my understanding of transformer architectures and MLOps principles for robust model deployment
- ðŸ’¬ Let's connect if you want to talk about implementing ML algorithms from first principles or translating complex mathematical concepts into Python code
