# Hello, my name is James👋


I am an AMEP (Applied Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics) major passionate about ML and computing hardware.

I am building a strong scientific foundation and aim to develop solutions at the intersection of ML and hardware.

- 🔭 Currently learning C and expanding my `c-projects` repo to demonstrate my low-level programming knowledge
- 🌱 Focused on deepening my understanding of transformer architectures and MLOps principles for model deployment
- 💬 Let's connect if you want to discuss implementing ML algorithms from first principles or translating mathematical concepts into Python code

## Featured Projects
- [math-tools](https://github.com/jamesmml/math-tools) - Computational solvers for linear algebra and differential equations
  - Determinant calculators using cofactor expansion
  - Euler and Runge-Kutta methods for solving ODEs
  - 2×2 linear system solver for homogeneous ODEs
  - Symbolic math with SymPy for flexible equation parsing
- [ml-from-scratch](https://github.com/jamesmml/ml-from-scratch) - **ML models built from scratch**
  - Linear & logistic regression  
  - Binary & multiclass classification  
  - Fully connected neural networks with forward/backward propagation, softmax, batch training, and more  
  - No external ML libraries - just NumPy
